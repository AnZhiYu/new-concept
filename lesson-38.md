everthing except the weather
first listen and then answer the question
why did harison sale his house so quickly
my old friend harison had lived in the meternares for many years before he returned to England
he had offen dream of retiring in england and had planed settle down in the country
he had no sooner returned than he bought a house and lived into there
almost imedutly he became to complain about the weather
for even though it was still summer, it rained contiune and it often bittely cold
after so many years of sunshine harison got a shock
he acted as if he had never lived in the england before
in the end it was more than he could bear
he had hardly had time to sellted down when he soled the house and left the country
the dream he had had for so many years ended there\
harison had thought everything and except the weather
